We roll two six sided dice,each with faces containing one ,two ,
three, four, five and  six respectively
When the dice come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated.
If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first roll , you  win
If the sum is 2,3,or 12 on the first roll,you lose
If the sum us 4,5,6,8,9 or 10 on the first roll , that sum becomes your "point"
To win you must continue rolling the dice until you make your point (ie roll that same point value)
You will lose by rolling a 7 before making your point
