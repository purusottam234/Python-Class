Program development:

if the algorithm is typically straightforward ,specified then we can easily implement in python

Requirement Statement:

describes what a program is supposed to do but not how the program should do it.

ex.
A class of ten students took a quize . Their grades (integers in the range 0-100) are 
98,76,87,83,90,57,79,82,94,54,71. Determine the class average on the quize.

algorithm:
1. keep a running total grades
2. calculate average
3.display the result

Pseudocode 

set total to 0
set counter (grade ) to 0
list of ten grade 
for each grade in a list:
  add the grade to total
  add one to the counter

set the class average to the total divided by number of grades
display the class average
